# Linear-Regression


The model assumption linear regression as follows

   1. In our model the actual vs predicted plot is curve so linear assumption fails
   2. The residual mean is zero and residual error plot right skewed
   3. Q-Q plot shows as value log value greater than 1.5 trends to increase
   4. The plot is exhibit heteroscedastic, error will insease after certian point.
   5. Variance inflation factor value is less than 5, so no multicollearity.
